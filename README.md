# PacMan Exercise
## Description
The idea of the exercise was to be able to move the PacMan within the user screen, reversing direction when the image detects a screen edge. Furthermore, understanding how we can manipulate html elements with the DOM was an important part of the exercise.

As a personal challenge, I added a ChangeColors function in order to set a new color each time PacMan makes a move.

## Instalation
Download all the files and open index.html to see how the animation works or go to the [project page](https://topaiin.github.io/PacManProject/).

## Usage
Educational purpose. Check the comments at *pacman.js* to see how code works.

## Roadmap
In the future I would like to be able to replicate the original game by adding fruits or objects that would be eaten by PacMan.

## Special Thanks
Thanks to freeCodeCamp for their initiative, especially [John Milga](https://github.com/john-smilga/javascript-basic-projects). I understood how to create random colors and apply them to a div element watching their [40 Javascript Projects for Begginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/#how-to-create-a-color-flipper)
